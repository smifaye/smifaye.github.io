# How we’re improving the accessibility of the Citizens Advice website
*This blog was co-authored by me and Sonia Turcotte from the customer journey team at Citizens Advice. You can [read the original on the Citizens Advice blog](https://wearecitizensadvice.org.uk/how-were-improving-the-accessibility-of-our-website-6eb544a712c5).*

New accessibility legislation for public sector bodies came into effect on 23 September 2020. The regulations state public sector bodies must make their website or mobile app more accessible.

## Doing an accessibility review
To start this work, we needed a better understanding of how we were doing on digital accessibility, so we planned a full accessibility audit of the public website.

The website was tested by designers Sonia and Shakira, following recommended practice from W3C. You can [read the Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM) on the W3C website](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM/).

First, we gathered a representative sample of web pages, forms and interactive elements, and crucial functionality like the location switcher and webchat. Next, we tested each web page against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (known as [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)), using a range of automated tools and manual checks.

Finally, we wrote a report for our team that outlined any accessibility issues and recommended how to fix them. The report also emphasised the importance of ongoing testing and research, including regular testing with disabled users.

After testing the public site, designers Sonia and Minnie also reviewed our adviser-only website, AdviserNet. As the websites are quite similar, we were able to conduct a smaller review, focusing on testing any templates that were different to the public site.

None of us were accessibility experts when we did this work, so it was a big learning curve, but it was also a very valuable experience. While we had previous experience designing for accessibility, doing the audit gave us a much richer understanding of the different requirements and why they’re important.

This meant we could share that knowledge with the rest of the team and other parts of the organisation. Accessibility isn’t one person’s responsibility and it’s important everyone understands how to design and build services and products that are accessible.
## Sharing our work
As part of the new legislation, public sector bodies are required to publish an accessibility statement that explains how accessible their website is, how to request information in a different format, which bits of the website don’t meet the accessibility regulations and how they plan to fix accessibility issues.
