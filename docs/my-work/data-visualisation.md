# Data visualisation
I'm interested in data and use it to inform content decision. Here are a few examples of Google Looker Studio reports I've created over the last few years.
## Search
It's important to understand how users end up on our website. One of the main ways I do this is by using search data. It also tells you what language your users are using.
## Internal search
This report shows what search terms people are using on internal search. You can filter by:
- search term
- search destination page
- date range

This data is important in understanding user behaviour, user language and page performance.

### Google search
This report shows what search terms people are using on Google. You can filter by:
- query
- landing page
- date range

## Google analytics
We use Google analytics as our web analytics tool. Google analytics can be difficult to understand so I designed a report to make it easier.
### Page views
This page is a simple view of page views over a period of time. It's often useful to narrow it down to specific pages.

### Web stats
The below screenshot shows the most common web stats someone might ask for. This page of the report is particularly useful for sharing with senior stakeholders.

## Page ratings
It's important to understand content performance so you can iterate. This report shows very high-level stats on page ratings over a period of time. Citizens Advice uses a 'Yes/No' rating system for the question 'Did this advice help?'.
