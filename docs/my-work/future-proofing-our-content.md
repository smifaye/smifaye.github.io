# Future-proofing our content
Citizens Advice is currently [migrating from one CMS to another]({% link docs/my-work/cms-migration.md %}). As part of this work, I designed a new content model that enables Citizens Advice to deliver content across many platforms at once.
## What is a content model?
A content model is a way to structure content within a CMS. It breaks down content into their component parts - for example, a table or design component. It gives you structure and organisation to your content. 
## What makes up a content model?
Content models have 2 important parts - content types and content fields.
### Content types
Content types are the components you'll see on the website. These could be things like a table of data, a banner or an image.

Content types can also be chunks of data - this is where content models become powerful for content designers. 
### Content fields
Content types are made up of content fields. For a simple example like a table of data, the content fields might be:
- table name
- audience - who is this going to be displayed to?
- body
- version information

## A real life example
It's often useful to think of a real life example when talking about abstract concepts like content models. An example I use when explaining our content model is how to make a cup of coffee.

1. To make a cup of coffee, you need a coffee cup - this represents our content model.
2. You can make all sorts of coffee like a flat white or latte - this represents our content types.
3. You then need some essential ingredients like water, coffee beans and milk - this represents our content fields
4. You can buy ready made coffee like nespresso pods - this represents our reusable content chunks

## Why use a content model?
A content model:
- helps to create consistency across the sites
- helps to remove duplication of content
- makes editing content easier and quicker
- makes sense for the single content store

## What does the Citizens Advice content model look like?
I created a spreadsheet to list all the content types and content fields.

This content model is used in our new CMS, Contentful.

## What did I do?
To complete this work, I worked with:
- other content designers on the team
- front-end developers
- back-end developers
- product managers
- user researchers
- data analysts

The most important part I needed to get right was making sure the content model made sense for other content designers in the team. They're the ones who'll be using the model in their jobs. I made sure we included them during the early stages of each part of the project to give feedback and get hands-on experience with the model.
## Future-proofing our content
This new model unlocks a lot of new things for content designers at Citizens Advice. We're no longer tied to the website as our only way of displaying content to users. In the future, we'll be able to [reuse content across different platforms]({% link docs/my-work/reusable-content.md %}).

We're using the new content model on [the immigration and family parts of the Citizens Advice website](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/immigration/).
