# Reusable content
I'm working on a project to confirm some assumptions we have about our new CMS, Contentful - its killer feature is reusable content. Using the [content model I designed]({% link docs/my-work/future-proofing-our-content.md %}) we can reuse content across many different parts of the website and even beyond.
## What is reusable content?
Reusable content is the concept of using the same or similar pieces of content in more than one place. 

It allows us to design ‘common’ pieces of content once, in one place. We can then embed the ‘common’ content in lots of different places. 

When we need to update content, we can change it in one place and that change will apply wherever we use that content.
## Benefits of reusable content
The benefits are clear. Reusable content:
- makes it easier to keep content up to date and accurate
- saves time when working in the CMS
- removes duplication or near-matches
- avoids copying and pasting where mistakes often happen
- creates consistency

## Risks of reusable content
Reusable content can become frustrating and confusing if there aren’t clear principles in place. 

There are a few risks with reusable content. It might mean:
- we spend more time trying to find reusable content
- it’s harder to 2i or fact check content
- we design content that’s too generic
- people edit reusable content to suit their purposes

## Reusable content principles
Reusable content needs to be:
-   easy to find
-   easy to share with others - for example, during 2i or fact check
-   generic enough to be reused, but contains all the details that meet a user need

### Easy to find
We store our content in Contentful. We can make the most of Contentful’s inbuilt features like ‘tags’ or ‘views’. 

Tags are a way of grouping content together by broad themes or topics. For example, you could add the Universal Credit standard amount for people who are single and under 25 and tag this as ‘Benefit rates’. 

Views are a way of saving a search filter within Contentful. For example, you could create a view that displays all the ‘Monetary amount’ content entries with the tag ‘Benefit rates’.
### Easy to share with others
If we’re editing content that’s reused, we need to understand each context so we can check it. We share our content with the 2i group, expert advice and Citizens Advice Scotland.

We could export reused content to a Google Doc and show how it’s used in each context. For example, if we use a callout in 5 advice collections, you could click a button in Contentful and export the 5 advice collections where we use that callout. This could generate 5 Google Docs or 1 large one. We’ll be able to provide the URL of the page and the URL of the entry in Contentful.

We’ll need to run a session with expert advice and agree how we share content in the future.
### Generic but meets a user need
This is an area where it will feel a little uncomfortable at first because of the way we currently design content. 

To make content reusable, it needs to be generic enough to use in different places. But, it still needs to meet a user need, otherwise it’s not adding any value.
#### Variables
A way to do this in the future might be to introduce the concept of variables. Variables allow you to set values for text. So instead of adding regular text, you insert a variable. 

We would store variables in a variable list. For example, you could have a variable called ‘Benefit’ with a list of values like ‘Universal Credit’ or ‘Housing Benefit’. Variables mean you can still make the content specific but insert different variables for each context.
