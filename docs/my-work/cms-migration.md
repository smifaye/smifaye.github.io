# CMS migration
I worked on a team that was responsible for migrating from one CMS to another. I worked in a multi-disciplinary team that included all sorts of different disciplines. This included developers, product owners, product designers, delivery managers, researchers and data analysts.
## Collaboration
The nature of the project required all disciplines to work with each other. When I [designed the new content model]({% link docs/my-work/future-proofing-our-content.md %}) I didn't work on this in isolation. It required lots of close work with back-end developers, user researchers and other content designers.

Collaboration is a part of my job I enjoy. Working together with another member of the team to tackle a challenge means we can share the success and pain.
## Migration challenges
One of our biggest user groups is content designers. Being a content designer, I know how they work and what things they might struggle with.

I've made sure to keep close communication with other content designers to understand how they're finding the new CMS.
### Growing pains
The new CMS we're using is pretty bare bones out of the box. Our team needs to build lots of features to provide a good user experience.

I gathered feedback from content designers about their experiences with the new CMS - it wasn't great. The main issue was lots of the features weren't built yet - for example, preview. I used this feedback to argue for prioritising content designer experience over other pieces of work. You can [read more about my part in designing these features]({% link docs/my-work/ux-content.md %}).
### Content migration
Migrating content from one CMS to another is hard, especially if a lot of that content hasn't been touched in many years.

When we first migrated content to the new CMS we relied on the code to do the work. We found the code wasn't able to catch all the different issues we would find. This meant the developers were having to edit the code each time we found a new problem - it wasn't sustainable.

I suggested a shift in approach to something more manual and content design led. This would mean we would be able to fix things much quicker and with less expense.
### Migration team
A result of this was the formation of a new sub-team called the migration team. We recruited 4 assistant content designers and a mid-weight content designer to lead the migration of content. 

The team is migrating content at a faster speed. The creation of this team allowed our developer to work on more features.
