# Hello, I'm Adam Smith.

I'm a content designer based in London.

As a content designer, I create user-centred content that puts user needs first.

I’m passionate about accessibility, plain English and content that helps people do what they need to.

I’ve worked in content design for over 7 years with roles in the public and charity sectors.
